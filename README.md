# Not Yet Fulfilled Prophecies
### An attempt is made to sort the prophecies in chronological order, based on the most likely sequence of events. All of the following will take place within the next 7-8 years from the time of this writing.
- Trump doing a peace deal with Israel and Saudi Arabia enabling the construction of the third temple.
- USA Trade Wars.
- Major shortages of medical supplies. Not enough medical supplies to do surgery.
- Rioting, looting in the cities.
- Major attacks on US soil. Terrorism of immense magnitude.
- Global economy crash of a lifetime. People lining up for food for miles.
- Everything money-related turns digital/crypto. The future 5-pillars of crypto are: BTC, XRP, ETH, SOL, DOGE. New regulations causing meme coins to fall like stars. 
- BRICS becomes the new world reserve currency and Soviet allies join BRICS.
- To counter BRICS, Trump introduces a currency named ***Amero*** with Canada and Mexico being the first memebers. The rest of the Allied nations will join the Amero alliance shortly after.
- World War 3 starts.
- Weather manipulation/warfare. A new intensity of storms/hurricanes never seen before, akin to super-hurricanes; super-tornadoes; super-hail; super-straight-line winds. The weather manipulators lose control of the weather resulting in severe drought in the US.
- Global new virus/pandemic that kills 350 million in just the Americas alone.
- Global famine happening in conjunction with the new virus.
- Emmanuel Macron rises up as the pre-antichrist. The same spirit that was on Hitler is going to come onto him. Hilter 2.0, if you may, but he is not the antichrist.
- Israel strikes Iran, targetting their oil refineries.
- Oil goes up to over $200 USD a barrel. Shortage of oil. People lining up for gas.
- Russia uses a new type of bomb never used before (or even seen before, for that matter) that killed the people but left the buildings intact. The location of strike is in Warsaw, Poland.
- Major draft in the USA that includes women as well as men. Due to the push for gender equality.
- Alien invasion/disclosure event.
- Rapture of the Church some time in the year 2028 (My best guess based on everything I've looked into).
- Antichrist is introduced. All power is given to him for 3.5 years. It will a man that comes from the Middle East region. He will mandate a one-world government, currency, and religion. You will be forced to worship him. He will mandate the **mind-control (aka. Mark of the Beast)** chip (based on a type of neurolink technology) that is to be implanted in your right hand or forehead. If you refuse, your head will be cut off. **If you take it, you will be damned to hell as it is the final rejection of God and free will.**
- Asteroid strikes off the coast of Florida, in the Atlantic Ocean.
- Portland and Seattle split from the US and sink into the sea.
- 10.0 earthquake that runs down the middle of the US nearly splitting the USA in half.
- Yellowstone supervolcano eruption.
- Italy supervolcano eruption.
- BTC ***values*** over $1m USD a coin.
- XRP ***values*** over $10k USD a coin.
- Jesus comes back with his raptured church.
- Millennium reign of Christ on Earth for 1000 years.


# My Personal Interpretation of the Times and Seasons
### This perspective is taken from considering multiple interpretations of the biblical prophecies and is the perspective that is most coherent when considering all the pieces of the puzzle. It is consistent with the biblical prophecies and modern day predictions that have been made.
- My personal speculation on the Emmanuel Macron prophecy is that he is going to be the person that introduces ethic cleansing of the Muslims in Europe. He has a track record of claiming that Islam is in crisis and has tried to reform Islam. He often has conflicts with the Islam community.
- Tribulations will start sometime this year (2025) and will last for 7 years. In the middle of the tribulations period (3.5 years as was written), the rapture of the church will take place. After which, the antichrist will be revealed and will take control of the world. He will establish a one-world government, one-world currency, and one-world religion. He will also implement a mark of the beast system that will require everyone to receive a chip in their right hand or forehead in order to buy or sell. Those who refuse to take the mark will be persecuted and killed.
- The antichrist will rule for 3.5 years, during which time there will be great tribulation and suffering on the earth. At the end of the 7-year tribulation period (3.5 years after the rapture), Jesus will return with his raptured church to defeat the antichrist and establish his kingdom on earth for 1000 years. This period is known as the Millennium Reign of Christ.

# Conclusion
If you have not yet given your life to Jesus, I urge you to do so now. The time is short, and the days are evil. The signs of the times are all around us, and it is clear that we are living in the last days. Jesus is the only way to salvation, and he is the only one who can save us from the coming judgment. If you have not yet accepted Jesus as your Lord and personal Savior, I encourage you to do so now. Repent of your sins, and ask Jesus to come into your heart and save you. He loves you and he wants to save you. Don't wait until it is too late. No one is promised tomorrow. Give your life to God, and submit fully unto Him, **NOW**, and be saved.

If you have already accepted Jesus as your Lord and personal Savior, I encourage you to stay strong in your faith and to keep looking up. The day of the Lord is at hand, and our redemption draws near. Be ready, be watchful, and be prepared. Keep your eyes on Jesus, and he will see you through. God bless you, and may the Lord keep you and protect you in the days ahead. Amen.
